# JGU-HIM-summer-internship
This is the collection of the work carried out during the stay at Helmholtz-Institut Mainz at Johannes Gutenberg University in the summer of 2025. 

It consists of the literature found, the performed data analysis, the codes created for fitting the models, the files from JGU Data Center, and the presentations from the meetings.

## Literature and Datasets
### 📊📄 ./Datasets 📊📄
Contains the collected papers on experiments involving empirical measurements of 7Li cross sections. (see [Pending tasks and future extensions](##-pending-tasks-and-future-extensions))
Also, contains the papers of ANC and Phase-shift used data. 

> Cross section data extracted from https://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor can be found in [Racam_sca Jupyter notebook](Sfactor/Racam_sca.ipynb) in **Manual S factor extraction** section.

### 📑 ./Support papers 📑
It consists of papers related to the research topic that were found in the initial literature search. (see [Pending tasks and future extensions](##-pending-tasks-and-future-extensions))

## Analysis of results with Jupiter notebooks

### 📈 ./Graphic outfile 📈
These are simply the functions for reading Boscos.f output files in .dep and .dfo format.

### 📝🧮 ./Sfactor 📝🧮
These are Jupyter notebooks containing the data analysis of the Boscos.f and Racam5.f outputs, for the final refits of the models and the S-factor contribution calculations.
#### ./Sfactor/Racam_sca.ipynb
The initial calculations of S-factor, first time using the Racam5.f code. The results are used for the [13/08/2025 meeting](<Meeting presentations/13-08 meet.pptx>)


## Pending tasks and future extensions

> Falta pdf de Griffiths

> Particularmente interesantes los papers de "apuntado"

> No se pudieron extraer los errores para Sfactor data Griffiths

> Exfor no estaba los datos de Sfactor para el paper de Burzynski, solo  angular differential cross section.
